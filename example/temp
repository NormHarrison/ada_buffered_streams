For now, our only custom exception is for indicating when the recursion limit
was reached. We have removed the declaration of the `Index_Type_Too_Small_Error`
exception for now, instead opting for allowing the languages automatic checks
to raise `Constraint_Error` in such cases. However, this could be ambigous to
the user, not knowing exactly what the problem was.

Continue determining the best way to handle creating stream access instances,
like making `Reader_Type` descend from `Ada.Finalization.Controlled`.
